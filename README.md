## Web Automation with Python and RobotFrameWork
In this tests I have used RobotFramework for testing valid and invalid login.
I can run the tests on different browsers, the default is edge.
The framework is based on page objects.
1. customLibraries - here I can create custom libraries which can be used in the tests
2. pageObjects - directory with page objects, one common page with variables and keywords which are commonly used. Also, there is one page for each tested webpage.
3. reports - in this directory are the reports which are generated after each test.
4. screenshots - directory for screenshots in case of test failure.
5. testData - directory with data for the tests, this time I have used csv file.
6.test - directory with the tests.
